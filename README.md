Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective management and prevention of complications associated with diabetes. Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machine, can be utilized to predict the risk of diabetes based on various factors and help healthcare professionals in making informed decisions. This Diabetes Prediction Project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm, to accurately forecast the likelihood of diabetes onset in individuals. By analyzing various health metrics and lifestyle factors, our SVM model offers personalized predictions, aiding in early detection and proactive management of diabetes.
